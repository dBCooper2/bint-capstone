# Business Intelligence and Data Analytics Capstone - DS 4510

## Structure

- `projects/` contains all notebooks for the project.
- `proj-docs/` contains any documentation, like data dictionaries, todo-lists, pretty much anything that is not code.
- `notebooks/` contains class notes (will remove if needed)

**Please make sure to edit the gitignore to contain your data files if they are saved in the repo on your local machine! Not doing this can break your ability to push changes due to the size of the data files, and we do not have LFS (Large File Sharing) set up!**
