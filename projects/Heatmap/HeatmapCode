1. Testing the Relationship Between Player Scoring and All-Star Selection - SCOTT

    Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference in the average points per game (PPG) between All-Star and non-All-Star players.
    Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): All-Star players have a significantly higher PPG than non-All-Star players.
    Test: Independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (if the data is not normally distributed).
    Why? If a strong relationship exists, logistic regression can be used to predict All-Star selection based on PPG and other stats.

    **Progress**: New relationship will be chosen using a correlation heatmap
